# Computer Science UILaunch
This is a "launcher" for a CS UIL programming contest for students to practice with, allowing students to run, check, and judge their code. It requires no (formal) compilation step and no external libraries, so it should work with a minimal Java install on "every" (Linux, MacOS, Windows) operating system.

## Running The Program (starting from GitHub)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/tacocarlos/cs-uilaunch.git
cd cs-uilaunch
java UILaunch.java
```

## TODO
- Add a feature to download the contest ZIP files straight from the UIL website
- Add a timer to simulate
- Have user code live in a "src/" directory to not pollute working dir
- copy student data files to "src/" directory
